For writing down ideas, tasks, etc.

Going to try to make a juggling game.
Control left hand and right hand with left stick and right stick respectively.
Hold respective trigger to clench hand, let go to open hand.

Initially, don't worry about sprites/animation being any good.

- Get two sprites that you can move around with the joysticks of
a xbox controller.

Going to try and use github for the tasking stuff.

Okay, lets go. ~@5:03PM
